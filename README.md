The system implemented the rules of the popular pencil-and-paper version of Boggle.
The system realized basic functions of the game, including starting the game, exiting the
game, and getting feedback after the game ends. Players will be interacting with the system
through a GUI, which will include a main menu page, game page, and the score summary page.
To make the game convenient and easy to understand, the GUI will be clear and simple.
